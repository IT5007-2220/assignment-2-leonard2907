# HTML
In the HTML code, I structured it in such a way that we have a title and navigation bar on top. In the middle of the page, we have the different contents that are toggled based on the tab selected by the user. There are 4 tabs which are the home, book, cancel and display. The home tab shows the number of seats left. The book tab is used for making boookings. The cancel tab is used to cancel bookings. The display tab is used to display the reservations made. I have also added the onclick event to some buttons to handle specific behaviors.

# CSS
In the CSS code, I am not using anything really fancy. Mostly just regular styling (background, font, positioning, paddings etc.). I also did an import from google fonts to use the Roboto font.

# JS
In the JavaScript code, I am using built in features for the timer and localstorage. I am also using the Date library to take the timestamp. I have also added validations for the user input and set up alerts according to the user actions.
